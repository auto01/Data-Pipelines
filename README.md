# Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

This project will introduce you to the core concepts of Apache Airflow. To complete the project, you will need to create your own custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.



## Datasets

For this project, you'll be working with two datasets. Here are the s3 links for each:

```
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
```

### Song Dataset
<br/>
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

Files are nested in subdirectories under song_data/
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.


- song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
- song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
<br/>
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

- log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
- log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

```

{"artist":"Slipknot","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Aiden","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Ramirez","length":192.57424,"level":"paid","location":"New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540283578796.0,"sessionId":19,"song":"Opium Of The People (Album Version)","status":200,"ts":1541639510796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"20"}

```
## Dimensional Model Schema


Fact table
```
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    playid, start_time, user_id, level, songid, artistid, sessionid, location, user_agent
```

Dimension table
```
users - users in the app
    userid, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
    songid, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
    artistid, name, location, lattitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
```

## Configuring the DAG
<hr/>

In the DAG, add default parameters according to these guidelines
```
The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs
On failure, the task are retried 3 times
Retries happen every 5 minutes
Catchup is turned off
Do not email on retry
```

In addition, configure the task dependencies so that after the dependencies are set, the graph view follows the flow shown in the image below.

## Building the operators

To complete the project, you need to build four different operators that will stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality.

All of the operators and task instances will run SQL statements against the Redshift database. However, using parameters wisely will allow you to build flexible, reusable, and configurable operators you can later apply to many kinds of data pipelines with Redshift and with other databases.

### Stage Operator
- The stage operator is expected to be able to load any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters should specify where in S3 the file is loaded and what is the target table.

- The parameters should be used to distinguish between JSON file. Another important requirement of the stage operator is containing a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

### Fact and Dimension Operators
- With dimension and fact operators, you can utilize the provided SQL helper class to run data transformations. Most of the logic is within the SQL transformations and the operator is expected to take as input a SQL statement and target database on which to run the query against. You can also define a target table that will contain the results of the transformation.

- Dimension loads are often done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. Thus, you could also have a parameter that allows switching between insert modes when loading dimensions. Fact tables are usually so massive that they should only allow append type functionality.

### Data Quality Operator
- The final operator to create is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.

- For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.



## Add Airflow Connections

For the purpose of this pipeline, connections aws_credentials and redshift must be created before running the DAG.

Go to localhost:8080 in your browser and click on the Admin tab and select Connections.

Under Connections, select Create.

On the create connection page, enter the following values:
- Conn Id: Enter aws_credentials.
- Conn Type: Enter Amazon Web Services.
- Login: Enter your Access key ID from the IAM User credentials you downloaded earlier.
- Password: Enter your Secret access key from the IAM User credentials you downloaded earlier.

Once you've entered these values, select Save and Add Another.

On the next create connection page, enter the following values:

- Conn Id: Enter redshift.
- Conn Type: Enter Postgres.
- Host: Enter the endpoint of your Redshift cluster, excluding the port at the end.
- Schema: Enter dev. This is the Redshift database you want to connect to.
- Login: Enter the login name you created when launching your Redshift cluster.
- Password: Enter the password you created when launching your Redshift cluster.
- Port: Enter 5439.

Once you've entered these values, select Save.

## Running the Pipeline

- The DAG should appear under the name sparkify-etl. 
- Once enabled, it will run daily for the period 10/01/2018 to 12/30/2018.
- To change the schedule, go to airflow/dags/sparkify-etl.py and modify the start_date and end_date arguments.
